# Networking Email Templates That Build Genuine Relationships

Networking is more than asking for favors—it's about nurturing relationships and offering value. These email templates help you reconnect authentically, spark conversations, and open doors without feeling transactional.

## Principles for Effective Networking Emails

- Lead with context and gratitude.
- Offer value before asking for help.
- Keep messages concise (under 150 words).
- Personalize every line—generic emails erode trust.
- Close with a low-pressure CTA.
