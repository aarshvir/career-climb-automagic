# Quarterly Portfolio Refresh Workflow for Job Seekers

Your portfolio is a living asset. Whether you're a marketer, product manager, designer, or operations leader, keeping it current boosts credibility and speeds up applications. Use this workflow each quarter to ensure your proof of work shines.

## Step 1: Audit Existing Assets

- List current case studies, decks, demos, and testimonials.
- Tag each by role relevance (product, growth, ops), industry, and outcome.
- Identify outdated or incomplete pieces.

## Step 2: Collect New Wins

- Review resume achievements, performance reviews, OKRs, and feedback.
- Gather artifacts: screenshots, dashboards, product releases, campaign metrics.
- Ask stakeholders for short testimonials or quotes.

## Step 3: Prioritize Stories

Use an ICE score (Impact, Confidence, Ease) to select which projects become case studies. Focus on stories that align with target roles.

## Step 4: Create a Case Study Template

Sections to include:

1. Context (company, role, problem).
2. Goal (what success looked like).
3. Approach (strategy, collaboration, tools).
4. Execution (steps taken, timeline, experiments).
5. Results (quantitative + qualitative outcomes).
6. Lessons + next steps.
7. Proof (links, visuals, testimonials).

## Step 5: Leverage Automation Tools

- Use Jobvance to pull metrics from your achievements library.
- Apply AI summarizers to draft narrative sections.
- Auto-generate design assets via Figma plugins or Canva templates.
- Store case studies in Notion or Webflow CMS for easy updates.

## Step 6: Optimize for Accessibility and SEO

- Add descriptive alt text to images.
- Use semantic headings and clear structure.
- Include keywords relevant to your role (e.g., "product-led growth experiments").
- Ensure fast load times by compressing media.

## Step 7: Build Supporting Assets

- Short teaser blurbs for outreach emails.
- Slide decks for interviews.
- Video walkthroughs (2–3 minutes) with captions.
- PDF versions for offline sharing.

## Step 8: Publish and Distribute

- Update your personal site or portfolio platform.
- Share highlights on LinkedIn or newsletters.
- Link case studies within resumes and cover letters via QR codes.
- Add to Jobvance's proof library for quick access during applications.

## Step 9: Measure Impact

Track metrics:

- Portfolio views and dwell time.
- Interview mentions referencing case studies.
- Conversion rate of outreach messages that include proof links.

## Step 10: Schedule Quarterly Refresh Ritual

- Block a 3-hour session each quarter to review metrics, add new stories, and retire outdated ones.
- Invite a trusted peer to review and provide feedback.
