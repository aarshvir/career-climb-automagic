# ATS Optimization Checklist for 2024

Applicant tracking systems (ATS) power the majority of corporate hiring pipelines, filtering thousands of applications before a human sees them. Optimizing for these systems doesn't mean gaming them—it means presenting your experience in structured, scannable formats that highlight relevance. Use this checklist to ensure every submission maximizes its chance of moving forward.

## 1. Start with the Right File Format

- Export your resume as both PDF and DOCX. Some ATS parse PDFs flawlessly; others prefer Word files.
- Avoid image-based resumes. Text must be selectable.
- Name files clearly: `Firstname-Lastname-Role-Company.pdf`.

## 2. Keep Layouts Simple

- Use single-column layouts or a narrow two-column design with main content in the left column.
- Stick to system fonts (Arial, Calibri, Helvetica) to avoid rendering issues.
- Replace icons with text labels. Screen readers and ATS struggle with decorative icons.

## 3. Structure Headings and Sections

- Standard section headers (Summary, Experience, Education, Skills) improve parsing accuracy.
- Use H2/H3 formatting or bold text to delineate sections.
- Place contact information at the top with accessible links (LinkedIn, portfolio).

## 4. Mirror Keywords Thoughtfully

- Extract keywords from the job description: tools, methodologies, certifications, outcomes.
- Integrate them naturally in bullet points, summary, and skills list.
- Include both spelled-out and abbreviated versions (e.g., "Customer Relationship Management (CRM)").

## 5. Quantify Achievements

- ATS often highlight numbers. Use metrics (percentages, growth, revenue, users) to validate impact.
- Pair metrics with context: "Increased activation by 24% by redesigning onboarding flow".

## 6. Use Bullet Points, Not Paragraphs

- Bullets improve readability and parsing.
- Begin with strong verbs (Launched, Led, Optimized).
- Limit to two lines per bullet for scannability.

## 7. Avoid Tables and Text Boxes

- Many ATS flatten tables or ignore text inside shapes.
- If you must use columns, rely on simple CSS or tableless designs.

## 8. Include Skills Section with Proficiency Context

- Group skills by category (Product, Data, Tools, Languages).
- Add proficiency or usage context ("Figma – daily wireframing", "SQL – analytical queries").
- Update quarterly to reflect new capabilities.

## 9. Optimize for Accessibility

- Use proper heading hierarchy for screen readers.
- Ensure sufficient color contrast.
- Provide alt text for any necessary icons or logos.

## 10. Align Cover Letters

- Submit cover letters as separate documents unless the application form includes a text box.
- Use keywords and refer to the same achievements as your resume for consistency.
- Keep paragraphs short and purposeful.

## 11. Tailor for Each Application

- Save each tailored resume within Jobvance using version control.
- Track which keywords were added and the resulting ATS match score.
- Use analytics to identify which variations produce interviews.

## 12. Validate with ATS Simulators

- Use Jobvance's ATS preview or reputable online scanners to check parsing accuracy.
- Confirm key sections map correctly and keywords register.

## 13. Maintain Clean Metadata

- Remove author names or tracked changes from documents.
- Update document properties to reflect current role and contact info.

## 14. Submit via Recommended Channels

- Whenever possible, apply through the company's primary ATS portal rather than third-party aggregators.
- Use referral links when available—they often bypass initial filters.

## 15. Log Everything

- Record application date, version of resume used, keywords emphasized, and follow-up actions.
- Review weekly to refine your approach.

Avoid them in ATS-facing versions. Use a separate portfolio or PDF for visuals.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Keyword stuffing**: Repeating the same word 10 times looks spammy. Aim for natural language.
- **Using headers/footers for contact info**: Some ATS ignore them. Keep essentials in the main body.
- **Forgetting to update dates**: Stale timestamps signal lack of care.
- **Submitting the wrong version**: Double-check attachments before hitting send.

## Pre-Submit Checklist

1. Confirm file names and formats are correct.
2. Run a quick spell check—typos can break keyword matches.
3. Verify links work and open in new tabs.
4. Save a copy of the job description in your tracker for future reference.
5. Schedule follow-up reminders immediately after submitting.
