# Set Up an AI Interview Coach in 60 Minutes

An AI interview coach can accelerate your preparation by generating tailored questions, simulating interviewers, and providing instant feedback. Here's how to spin up a system that complements human coaching and keeps you accountable.

## Step 1: Clarify Your Interview Targets

- List the roles, levels, and industries you're targeting.
- Identify core competencies (product sense, analytics, leadership, system design).
- Gather job descriptions and interview prep guides for reference.

## Step 2: Choose Your Tools

- **Jobvance**: Centralizes prep docs and integrates AI prompts.
- **ChatGPT / Claude / Gemini**: Generate questions and evaluate answers.
- **Notion / Coda**: Store transcripts and track improvements.
- **Loom / Grain**: Record practice sessions for review.

## Step 3: Build Prompt Templates

1. **Question Generator**

```
You are a hiring manager for a {{role}} role at a {{company type}}. Ask me one interview question focused on {{competency}}. Include follow-up prompts if my answer lacks depth.
```

2. **Answer Critique**

```
Evaluate my response using STAR. Highlight strengths, gaps, and suggestions for improvement. Rate clarity, impact, and alignment with the role on a 1-5 scale.
```

3. **Story Selector**

```
Based on the question, suggest which stories from my inventory best fit. Here's my story bank: {{story_bank}}
```

## Step 4: Create a Story Library

- Document 10–15 STAR stories covering leadership, conflict, impact, failure, and innovation.
- Include metrics, stakeholders, tools, and lessons learned.
- Tag each story with competencies and industries.

## Step 5: Schedule Practice Cadence

- Daily 20-minute drills focusing on different competencies.
- Weekly 60-minute full mock interviews.
- Monthly retro to assess progress and adjust focus areas.

## Step 6: Capture and Analyze Sessions

- Record sessions, transcribe automatically, and highlight sections to improve.
- Use AI to summarize feedback and extract action items.
- Track trends in clarity, confidence, and structure scores.

## Step 7: Integrate Human Feedback

- Share transcripts with mentors or peers for additional perspective.
- Invite them to score answers and suggest new questions.
- Combine AI and human notes in your prep doc.

## Step 8: Measure Improvement

- Track time to answer, filler word count, and clarity scores.
- Monitor interview outcomes after implementing the AI coach.
- Celebrate milestones (e.g., improved scores, positive interviewer feedback).

## Step 9: Maintain Ethical Guardrails

- Avoid feeding confidential company data into AI tools.
- Cross-check AI feedback against real-world expectations.
- Use AI as a supplement—not a substitute—for authentic storytelling.

## FAQs

### How often should I refresh prompts?
Monthly, or whenever you target new roles.

### Can AI replace mock interviews with humans?
No. Use AI for repetition and feedback, then practice with humans for nuance.

### What if AI feedback conflicts with human feedback?
Default to trusted human advisors. Use discrepancies as discussion points.

## Step 10: Integrate with Scheduling Tools

- Sync prep sessions with Google Calendar or Fantastical.
- Use automation to send reminder emails with prep docs attached.
- Block cooldown time before and after interviews to reflect and recharge.

## Case Study: From Nervous Speaker to Confident Storyteller

Diego, a customer success leader, used this setup to prepare for director-level interviews:

1. Built a story bank spanning renewals, churn reduction, and cross-functional leadership.
2. Practiced daily with AI prompts focused on executive presence.
3. Shared transcripts with a mentor who added context on stakeholder alignment.
4. Tracked improvements—clarity scores rose from 3.0 to 4.6. He landed an offer within six weeks.

## Maintenance Checklist

- Refresh story bank monthly with new metrics.
- Rotate prompt variations to avoid memorized responses.
- Archive outdated transcripts while preserving key learnings.
- Revisit feedback trends quarterly to identify new focus areas.

## Resource Library

- Interviewing.io and Exponent for live practice.
- "The Pyramid Principle" for structured communication.
- Toastmasters or improv classes for in-person confidence.
- Jobvance interview template pack for prep docs and thank-you notes.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **AI responses feel generic**: Provide more context in prompts or add sample answers.
- **Over-reliance on scripts**: Schedule improv sessions without prompts to stay agile.
- **Feedback overload**: Prioritize two improvements per week to avoid overwhelm.


## Scorecard Template

Create a simple scorecard for each session:

| Metric | Description | Score (1-5) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Clarity | Logical flow, structured answers |  |  |
| Impact | Quantified results, relevance |  |  |
| Presence | Confidence, pacing, tone |  |  |
| Listening | Ability to address follow-ups |  |  |
| Story fit | Alignment with role expectations |  |  |

Automate scorecard population via Notion templates and update trends weekly.

## Weekly Review Ritual

1. Summarize key takeaways from each session.
2. Identify top two focus areas for improvement.
3. Plan the next week's prompt mix accordingly.
4. Share highlights with accountability partners.

## Celebrate Progress

When you hit milestones (e.g., 20 sessions completed, scores above 4.5), reward yourself. Positive reinforcement keeps momentum high.


## Long-Term Maintenance

Revisit your AI coach setup each quarter. Update prompts to reflect new seniority levels, add fresh stories, and integrate feedback from recent interviews. Continuous refinement keeps the system aligned with your evolving goals.
