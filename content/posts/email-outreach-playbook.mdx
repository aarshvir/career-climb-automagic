# Email Outreach Playbook for Landing Conversations

Thoughtful outreach can unlock interviews faster than submitting resumes alone. This playbook pairs automation with empathy so your emails feel bespoke, even at scale.

## Set Clear Outreach Goals

- Number of quality conversations per week.
- Roles or companies you want to prioritize.
- Metrics to track: response rate, positive reply rate, meeting conversions.

## Build Your Target List

1. Identify decision-makers (recruiters, hiring managers, cross-functional leaders).
2. Capture accurate emails using verified tools (Apollo, Clay, Clearbit).
3. Segment contacts by relationship strength (warm, lukewarm, cold).
4. Log everything in Jobvance with tags for company, role, and priority.

## Craft a 4-Touch Cadence

| Touch | Timing | Goal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Day 0 | Introduce value + hook |
| 2 | Day 2 | Share proof or resource |
| 3 | Day 6 | Address potential objection |
| 4 | Day 10 | Final check-in with graceful exit |

Automation schedules reminders, but you send each email manually to maintain control.

## Email Structure That Works

1. **Personal hook**: Reference recent news, a product launch, or content they shared.
2. **Value statement**: Explain how your expertise aligns with their priority.
3. **Proof**: Share one quantified achievement or case study link.
4. **CTA**: Ask for a call, intro, or feedback.

## Templates (Customize Heavily)

- **Initial outreach**: "Hi {{name}}, congrats on {{recent milestone}}. I've helped {{company type}} reduce {{problem}} by {{metric}} and would love to share a teardown. Open to a 15-minute chat next week?"
- **Proof follow-up**: "Wanted to pass along a Loom showing how I scaled {{similar project}}—curious if these insights resonate with {{company}}'s goals."
- **Objection handler**: "Understand if hiring is paused. Happy to stay in touch—here's a dashboard audit I created that might spark ideas."
- **Final check-in**: "Last note unless I hear back—thanks for considering! If now isn't right, I'll keep cheering from afar."

## Personalization Tips

- Mention mutual connections or communities.
- Reference public statements or podcasts.
- Offer a quick win (audit, insight, template).
- Keep sentences short; aim for 125–150 words.

## Track Metrics and Iterate

- Response rate (target 25%+).
- Positive replies (target 12–15%).
- Meetings booked.
- Referrals generated.

Review weekly. Tweak subject lines, CTAs, and proof points accordingly.

## Deliverability Safeguards

- Authenticate sending domain (SPF, DKIM, DMARC).
- Warm up inboxes gradually (Start with 10/day, increase to 40/day max).
- Avoid spam trigger words and heavy formatting.
- Use unsubscribe or opt-out language.

## Using Jobvance for Outreach

- Store templates with dynamic fields.
- Auto-log sends and sync replies via Gmail integration.
- Trigger tasks for follow-ups and referral requests.

## FAQs

### How many outreach emails should I send per day?
12–20 well-crafted emails beats 100 generic blasts. Focus on quality.

### Should I use LinkedIn messages instead?
Use both. Start with email; follow up on LinkedIn if you share context.

### What if no one replies?
Revisit targeting, value proposition, and proof. Ask mentors to audit your emails.

## Subject Line Ideas to Test

- "Idea for {{company}}'s onboarding funnel"
- "Quick data point on {{metric}}"
- "Referral from {{mutual connection}}"
- "Loved your post about {{topic}}"
- "Fan of {{product}}—mind a question?"

Track open rates to see which resonate.

## Case Study: Turning Cold Outreach into a Panel Interview

Alex, a product operations leader, targeted a company expanding into Europe:

1. Researched the company's launch roadmap via press releases.
2. Crafted an email offering a cross-border playbook from previous roles.
3. Shared a Loom walkthrough of a dashboard template.
4. Followed up with an objection handler acknowledging timing challenges.
5. Secured a panel interview within a week.

Key takeaway: leading with a tangible asset demonstrates value immediately.

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

- Respect privacy laws (GDPR, CAN-SPAM). Include contact info and opt-out language.
- Avoid scraping personal emails from private communities without consent.
- Store prospect data securely and delete upon request.

## Experimentation Roadmap

- Test sending times (morning vs. afternoon).
- Alternate between short and slightly longer emails.
- Compare text-only vs. light formatting.
- Measure performance by company stage or industry.

## Collaboration Workflow

Create an outreach pod with peers:

- Share weekly wins and templates.
- Review each other's emails before sending.
- Swap referral opportunities.
- Celebrate replies to maintain motivation.


## Outreach Analytics Dashboard

Build a simple dashboard (Sheets or Notion) with:

- Total emails sent per week.
- Open rate, response rate, meeting conversion.
- Breakdown by persona (recruiter vs. hiring manager).
- Notes column capturing qualitative feedback.

Sync this with Jobvance exports for real-time insights.

## Multi-Channel Follow-Up Strategy

After the email cadence:

- Connect on LinkedIn referencing the email.
- Engage with the contact's posts for two weeks.
- Offer value in relevant communities where they participate.
- Circle back in 60 days with an update on your progress.

This approach keeps you top-of-mind without overwhelming recipients.
